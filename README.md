# FP Complete's Haskell Homepage

**TODO**

* Review color scheme
* Decide: do we want a blog here, or just use fpcomplete.com?
* Add appropriate license, import content from other repos with licensing worked out
* Fix top and bottom navbars
* Address all FIXMEs and undefineds in codebase
* Import content from fpcomplete.com, at least haskell-syllabus and some linked pages
* Add a sitemap
* Include "Edit on Github" links on pages
* Add automatic 404 checking
* Add a /build-version
* Boring Haskell Manifesto: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nqpx0wSgmdhIO-aWffc3MGR45w4MNOyW8Zbo0eGILII/edit
* Guides: how do I get started with Haskell? How do I convince my boss to use Haskell? How do I hire Haskellers?

## Purpose

FP Complete was founded on a vision of functional programming in
general, and Haskell in particular, being a Good Thing. We continue
with this mission today, and seek to __Promote the commercial adoption
of Haskell__. This website is intended to consolidate our efforts on
the documentation and outreach front.

As such, this site intends to contain:

* Library documentation
* Our recommended best practices
* Opinionated guides on how to use Haskell
* Advice for promoting Haskell at your company
* Explanation of our service offerings that can help with that
* Links to additional community resources

## Contributions

We welcome contributions to this site from the wider community!
Wherever possible we include "Edit on Github" links on our pages, and
try to stick to Markdown for input formats for ease of use. Note that:

* Unless otherwise noted, content is owned by FP Completed and
  licensed as described above.
* By submitting a pull request, you affirm that you have ownership of
  the material and agree to assign copyright to FP Complete.

We welcome others to share content on this site that they feel useful
with others, either via links to the content or directly. If you
include raw content from this site elsewhere, please include a link
back to the original, as we will update our recommendations over time
to meet current versions of tools and libraries and evolving best
practices.

## History

This website replaces some previous false starts (and mistakes) at trying to create an opinionated hub of Haskell information. Previously, some FP Complete members participated in haskell-lang.org as another vision of an opinionated Haskell site. Later, we sought out collaborators for creating a more complete Commercial Haskell website.

haskell-lang.org was a mistake, and there was insufficient interest in
commercialhaskell.com. As such, we decided to focus efforts on a site
under our own branding and control.

This site is unapologetically opinionated, and follows what we have
found to be the best route towards getting productive with Haskell
quickly.
