# How to Build with Stack

This tutorial assumes you've already installed the Stack build
tool. If you haven't yet, please start with the
[get started page](/get-started) and then come back here.

In this article we'll be talking about how to build full fledged
projects consisting of libraries, executables, test suites, and
benchmarks in Haskell with Stack.

__FIXME__ This still needs to be written, for now, please see
[the Stack user guide](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/).
