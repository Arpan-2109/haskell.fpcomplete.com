# Applied Haskell

* Course by FP Complete
* Presented by Michael Snoyman
* Before LambdaConf 2018

## Overview

* Haskell is a "revolutionary" language
* We don't care about that today very much
* How do I get things done in Haskell?
* Focus:
    * Familiarity with best-in-class libraries
    * Get better at picking up Haskell idioms
    * Learn tooling a bit more
    * Pick up runtime system idiosyncracies

### What we won't do

* Focus on advanced features of the language
    * If they come up, we'll cover them, but they're not the focus
* Learn math or category theory
    * We just want to do enough to be proficient with common libraries
* Teach basic Haskell syntax
    * Assuming such basic familiarity as a prereq

### What you should do

* Ask questions
* Bring up real-world problems you've encountered
* This should be an interactive session as much as possible, __no one
  be shy!__

### Structure

* See the sections in <README.md>
* Going to introduce many sections with a challenge exercise
    * We'll do the exercise at the end of each section
    * Try to tie the information I'm presenting to the exercise!
* Mini exercises throughout
* Bonus challenges to try out on your own later
