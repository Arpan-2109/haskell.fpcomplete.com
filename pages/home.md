## Why Haskell?

Haskell is an advanced, purely-functional programming language. Its
focus on strong, static typing and declarative code leads to code we
believe is **easy to maintain**, **productive to write**, and
**competitive in performance**. Haskell is a general purpose language,
with significant usage in:

* Front end web development
* Back end web development
* Concurrent and parallel programming
* Cluster computing
* Financial modeling
* Scientific and biotech modeling
* Machine learning
* Parsing

## About FP Complete

FP Complete was founded on the vision that functional programming in
general, and Haskell in particular, can improve the quality of
software development. We believe in using better tools to produce
better results, and consider Haskell one of the best tools around. We
have contributed significantly to the Haskell ecosystem, and continue
to maintain large parts of the library and infrastructure ecosystem.

Our team consists of Haskell and DevOps engineers with significant
experience in the FinTech, Life Sciences, Blockchain, and network/web
services spaces. We contribute regularly to upstream Haskell projects
and have founded and maintained such things as [the Stack build
tool](https://haskellstack.com), [Stackage](https://www.stackage.org),
[the Yesod web framework](https://www.yesodweb.com), and [the RIO
standard library](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio).

Learn more about FP Complete on [our about page](/about) or [our
corporate website](https://www.fpcomplete.com). We also regularly
publish Haskell content [on our
blog](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog).

## Why these choices?

The recommendations on this site are unapologetically
opinionated. This is based on our experience developing in-house, open
source, and customer software at FP Complete. We've tried to capture
these ideas in our [philosophy page](/philosophy).
