<p class="lead">Dependable server software through better languages and tools</p>

FP Complete's mission is to improve the state of software quality in
the world. We believe software should be reliable, efficient, and
maintainable. Software projects must have clear vision and direction
while remaining responsive to changes in requirements. The world today
depends on software. We want to make that software better.

We focus on server side software, performing tasks ranging from large
scale data computation to responsive web applications. Our passion is
in architecting, developing, testing, and deploying top quality
software.

## DevOps

For years, development and operations teams have been separated. Code
has been proverbially&mdash;and sometimes literally&mdash;thrown over
the wall. Too many bugs have been caused by mismatches in
environments, unmet runtime expectations, and insufficient quality
assurance. [DevOps](/devops) is both a culture and tooling shift aimed
at reducing these problems.

## Languages

The software world is full of programming languages. Various languages have advantages for specific domains, whether by virtue of powerful languages or special support on the target platform. We acknowledge the reality of this world, and will adapt our language selection process to match the problem at hand. When the choice presents itself, we believe languages promoting strong typing to help avoid bugs at compile time, before the code is ever run. We especially love [Haskell](/haskell) and [Rust](/rust).

## Tools

To err is human. Hoping that engineers make no mistakes is not a
realistic strategy. We spend significant time researching, analyzing,
selecting, and creating tooling and processes to provide teams the
support they need to work quickly while minimizing mistakes, while
still retaining the flexibility and creativity your team needs to
thrive.
