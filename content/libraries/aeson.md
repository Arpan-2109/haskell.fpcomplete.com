title: Working with JSON data
---

aeson is an efficient and easy to use library for decoding (parsing) and
encoding JSON. The ways to work with aeson ranges from simple (but inflexible)
to complex (but flexible).

## API docs

The API documentation can be found
[here](https://www.stackage.org/lts-12.21/package/aeson). There's plenty
of good information in the API docs.

## Decoding and encoding standard data types

JSON strings can trivially be decoded to Haskell values, provided that the types
of those values are instances of `FromJSON`. Analogously, types that are
instances of `ToJSON` can easily be encoded back to JSON strings. aeson comes
with convenient `FromJSON` and `ToJSON` instances for the standard data types
(numbers, booleans, lists, tuples, dates, and so on).

Let's try these instances out in GHCi. You'll need to import `Data.Aeson`,
`Data.Map` and `Data.Time.Clock` in order to try out the examples above. You'll
also need to launch GHCi with `ghci -XOverloadedStrings`.

    λ> decode "true" :: Maybe Bool
    Just True

    λ> encode True
    "true"

    λ> decode "[1, 2, 3]" :: Maybe [Int]
    Just [1,2,3]

    λ> encode [1, 2, 3]
    "[1,2,3]"

    λ> decode "\"1984-10-15T00:00:00Z\"" :: Maybe UTCTime
    Just 1984-10-15 00:00:00 UTC

    λ> encode (read "1984-10-15 00:00:00 UTC" :: UTCTime)
    "\"1984-10-15T00:00:00Z\""

    λ> decode "{ \"foo\": 0, \"bar\":1, \"baz\": 2 }" :: Maybe (Map Text Int)
    Just (fromList [("bar",1),("baz",2),("foo",0)])

    λ> encode (fromList [ ("bar" :: Text, 1 :: Int)
                        , ("baz" :: Text, 2 :: Int)
			, ("foo" :: Text, 0 :: Int) ])
    "{\"bar\":1,\"baz\":2,\"foo\":0}"

## Automatic decoding and encoding

So how do you define `FromJSON` and `ToJSON` instances for types that don't have
them?

One simple way to do this is to use the `DeriveGeneric` extension and have the
compiler generate the implementation for you.

``` haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack script --resolver lts-12.21
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Data.Aeson
import Data.Text
import GHC.Generics

data Person = Person { name :: Text, age :: Int } deriving (Generic, Show)

instance FromJSON Person
instance ToJSON Person

main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn $ "Encode: " ++ (show (encode (Person { name = "Joe", age = 12 })))
    putStrLn $ "Decode: " ++
        (show (decode "{ \"name\": \"Joe\", \"age\": 12 }" :: Maybe Person))
```

For compatibility reasons, the default `DeriveGeneric` `ToJSON` implementation
is relatively slow. So for better efficiency, you might want to override the
`toEncoding` function `ToJSON` instance with:

``` haskell
instance ToJSON Person where
    toEncoding = genericToEncoding defaultOptions
```

You can also derive instances at compile-time, using `Data.Aeson.TH` and the
`TemplateHaskell` extension.

## Decoding and encoding in your own way

`FromJSON` and `ToJSON` instances can also be written by hand.

For `FromJSON` (decoding), you need to define the `parseJSON` function, which
takes a JSON value (of the aeson type `Value`) and returns a Haskell value of
your type. In order to define your own `ToJSON` instance, you need to do the
reverse - create a `Value` from a Haskell value of your type.

``` haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack script --resolver lts-12.21
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Control.Applicative
import Data.Aeson
import Data.Text (Text)

-- Same type as before, but without the Generic instance.
data Person = Person { name :: Text, age :: Int } deriving Show

-- We expect a JSON object, so we fail at any non-Object value.
instance FromJSON Person where
    parseJSON (Object v) = Person <$> v .: "name" <*> v .: "age"
    parseJSON _ = empty

instance ToJSON Person where
    toJSON (Person name age) = object ["name" .= name, "age" .= age]

-- The main function is unchanged from before.
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn $ "Encode: " ++ (show (encode (Person { name = "Joe", age = 12 })))
    putStrLn $ "Decode: " ++
        (show (decode "{ \"name\": \"Joe\", \"age\": 12 }" :: Maybe Person))
```

Above, `parseJSON` constructs the Haskell value using a JSON object. If some
other kind of JSON value is provided, decoding will fail. Note that `parseJSON`
above operates in an `Applicative` `Parser` context. This is what `parseJSON`
could look like using a monadic computation:

``` haskell
instance FromJSON Person where
    parseJSON (Object v) = do
        name <- v .: "name"
        age <- v .: "age"
        return (Person { name = name, age = age })
    parseJSON _ = empty
```

The `toJSON` function above uses the `object` function to define a JSON object,
which takes a list of key-value `Pair` values. The `Pair` type is simply defined
as `(Text, Value)`, and `.=` is a helper to encode the right-hand side to its
corresponding JSON value.

## Working with a arbitrary JSON data

Sometimes you want to work with the JSON data without actually converting it to
some specific type first. One way to do this is to work with the JSON [abstract
syntax tree (AST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree). This can
be done by simply decoding it to a `Value`, like so:

    λ> decode "{ \"foo\": false, \"bar\": [1, 2, 3] }" :: Maybe Value
    Just (Object (fromList [("foo",Bool False),("bar",Array [Number 1.0,Number
    2.0,Number 3.0])]))

You can also decode your JSON string to any of the JSON types that `Value`
encapsulates:

<table class="table">
<tr><th> JSON          </th><th> aeson Type    </th><th> Standard Type        </th></tr>
<tr><td> Array         </td><td> <code>Array</code>       </td><td> <code>Vector Value</code>       </td></tr>
<tr><td> Boolean       </td><td> <code>Bool</code>        </td><td> <code>Bool</code>               </td></tr>
<tr><td> Number        </td><td> <code>Number</code>      </td><td> <code>Scientific</code>         </td></tr>
<tr><td> Object        </td><td> <code>Object</code>      </td><td> <code>HashMap Text Value</code> </td></tr>
<tr><td> String        </td><td> <code>String</code>      </td><td> <code>Text</code>               </td></tr>
</table>

Once you have a JSON value, you can define a `Parser` like we did in `parseJSON`
above, and run it using `parse`, `parseEither` or `parseMaybe`.

Decoding JSON to a specific Haskell type is actually a two-step process - first,
the JSON string is converted to a `Value`, and then the `FromJSON` instance is
used to convert that `Value` to the specific type.
