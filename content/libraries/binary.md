*binary* is straightforward to use library for decoding (parsing)
and encoding binary data. There are a number of ways to work with
binary, ways that range from simple to complex.


## Decoding and encoding standard data types.

Byte strings can be trivially decoded to Haskell values, provided that the types of those values are instances of `Binary`. Analogously, types that are instances of `Binary` can easily be encoded back to byte strings. *binary* comes with convenient `Binary` instances for a good number of the standard data types including numbers, booleans, lists, tuples, and so on.

Let us try these instances out in GHCi. You'll need to import
`Data.Binary` to run the examples below.

```
> encode True
"\SOH"

> decode (encode True) :: Bool
True

> encode 'A'
"A"

> decode (encode 'A') :: Char
'A'

> encode "AB"
"\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\STXAB"

> decode (encode "AB") :: String
"AB"

> encode ("A", "B")
"\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\SOHA\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\NUL\SOHB"

> decode (encode ("A", "B") ):: (String, String)
("A","B")
```

## Automatic decoding and encoding

So how do you define `Binary` instances for types that do not already have them?

One simple way to do this is to use the `DeriveGeneric` extension
and have the compiler generate the implementation for you.

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-7.4 runghc
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Data.Binary
import Data.Text
import GHC.Generics (Generic)

data Transaction =
  Txn { account :: Text, amount :: Float }
  deriving (Generic, Show)

instance Binary Transaction

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let bytes = encode (Txn { account = "Cash", amount = 10 })
  putStrLn $ "Encode: " ++ show bytes
  putStrLn $ "Decode: " ++
    show (decode bytes :: Transaction)
```

## Custom decoding and encoding

`Binary` instances may also be written by hand.

For decoding, you need to define `get`, of type `Get t` where `Get` is an instance of `Monad`.

For encoding, you need to provide a definition for `put`, which is a function that takes a value of the type you wish to encode and a value of type `Put`. By definition, `Put = PutM ()`
where `PutM` is also an instance of `Monad`.

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc --resolver lts-7.4 runghc
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Data.Binary
import Data.Text (Text)


data Transaction =  -- Same type as before, but without the Generic instance.
  Txn { account :: Text, amount :: Float } deriving Show

instance Binary Transaction where
  put (Txn acct amt) = do
    put acct
    put amt

  get = do
    acct <- get
    amt <- get
    return $ Txn acct amt


main :: IO () -- The main action is unchanged from before.
main = do
  let bytes = encode (Txn { account = "Cash", amount = 1000 })
  putStrLn $ "Encode: " ++ show bytes
  putStrLn $ "Decode: " ++
    show (decode bytes :: Transaction)
```


## Conclusion

While quite straightforward to use, the *binary* library is vulnerable to two criticisms. Firstly, as its creator Duncan Coutts pointed out, `binary` entangles the issue of serializing Haskell values with that of read/writing externally defined formats. This can be confusing. Secondly, the error messages one may encounter when using `binary`are perhaps not as helpful as one would like. The `cereal` library offers to address the latter (though not the former) problem.
