title: Safe and simple exception handling
---

We previously recommended using the `safe-exceptions` library for exception
handling. We now recommend moving over to the `UnliftIO.Exception` module,
which has [its own tutorial](/tutorial/exceptions).

If you're still interested in the `safe-exceptions` library, please see [its
README.md](https://github.com/fpco/safe-exceptions/#readme).
