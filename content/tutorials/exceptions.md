title: Safe exception handling
---

Exception handling can be a bit of a black art in most programming
languages with runtime exceptions. Haskell's situation is even more
complicated by the presence of *asynchronous exceptions* (described
below). On top of that, the functions provided in the
`Control.Exception` module make it particularly difficult to get all
of the details right.

This tutorial provides instruction on how to do things the right way
in Haskell. It's a good idea to understand all of the gory details
under the surface as well, though you can get far without those
details. There is a blog post, webcast recording, and set of slides
available providing an in-depth look at all of this called [Async
Exception Handling in
Haskell](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/04/async-exception-handling-haskell).

In this tutorial, we're going to focus on:

* What "safe exception handling" means, at a high level
* Which functions to use
* Common patterns
* Pitfalls to avoid

What we won't do here:

* Cover the full motivation for the design of the libraries in question
* Debate the merits of runtime exceptions
* Debate the merits of asynchronous exceptions

## `UnliftIO.Exception`

Instead of using the `Control.Exception` module, we recommend using the
`UnliftIO.Exception` module from the `unliftio` package. It provides
two important advantages over `Control.Exception`:

* It works in more monads than just `IO` by using the `MonadIO` and
  `MonadUnliftIO` typeclasses, see [the `unliftio`
  library](/library/unliftio) for more information
* It handles asynchronous exceptions better, as we'll describe below

The `UnliftIO.Exception` module is reexported from both the `UnliftIO`
and `RIO` modules (see [the `rio` library](/library/rio)). For our
examples, we're simply going to use `RIO`.

## What is safe exception handling?

The definition we're going to use is "all resources are cleaned up
promptly despite the presence of an exception." It's easiest to see
what safe exception handling is by counterexample. Try to identify
what is unsafe here:

```haskell
foo :: IO Result
foo = do
  resource <- openResource
  result <- useResource resource
  closeResource resource
  pure result
```

If `useResource` throws an exception, then `closeResource` will never
be called, which would be unsafe resource handling. In reality, we
could ensure that the garbage collector cleans up the resources for
us, but that fails our "promptly" requirement, since we have no
guarantees of when the garbage collector will know it can clean up the
resource. For some resources like file descriptors, this can easily
cause your entire program to crash.

If you're familiar with most languages with runtime exceptions, you
may think that the following is safe:

```haskell
foo :: IO Result
foo = do
  resource <- openResource
  eitherResult <- try $ useResource resource
  closeResource resource
  case eitherResult of
    Left e -> throwIO e
    Right result -> pure result
```

Firstly, the above code won't compile (we'll see why in the next
section). However, even if we fix it so that it _does_ compile, it's
still broken. Haskell's runtime system includes _asynchronous
exceptions_. These allow other threads to kill our thread. In [the
async library](/library/async), we use this to create useful functions
like `race`. But in exception handling, these are a real pain. In the
code above, an async exception could be received after the `try`
completes but before the `closeResource` call.

Even helpful functions like `finally` aren't sufficient in this
case. As an exercise, try to figure out how asynchronous exceptions
could cause `closeResource` to not be called in this code:

```haskell
foo :: IO Result
foo = do
  resource <- openResource
  finally
    (useResource resource)
    (closeResource resource)
```

**Solution** In this case, an asynchronous exception could be received
between the call to `openResource` finishing and `finally`
beginning. The correct way to use this is to use the `bracket`
function (which we'll go into more detail on below):

```haskell
foo :: IO Result
foo = bracket openResource closeResource useResource
```

You can also address this with explicit usage of low level *exception
masking* functions. We're explicitly not going to cover that in this
tutorial, since it's error prone and rarely needed. Try to stick to
the functions we discuss, like `catch` and `bracket`. The in depth
blog post linked above provides the full gory details if desired.

## How to throw exceptions

There are three different ways exceptions can be thrown in Haskell:

* Synchronously thrown: an exception is generated from `IO` code and
  thrown inside a single thread
* Asynchronously thrown: an exception is thrown from one thread to
  another thread to cause it to terminate early
* Impurely thrown: an exception is generated from pure code, and gets
  thrown when a thunk is forced

Asynchronous throwing is the odd man out here, so let's ignore it for
the moment. When it comes to synchronous throwing, we use the
`throwIO` function (or something built on top of it). For example:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-12.21 script
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import RIO

-- boilerplate, we'll get to this in a bit
data MyException = MyException
  deriving (Show, Typeable)
instance Exception MyException

main :: IO ()
main = runSimpleApp $ do
  logInfo "This will be called"
  throwIO MyException
  logInfo "This will never be called"
```

By contrast, the `impureThrow` function creates a value which, when
forced, will throw an exception. For example:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-12.21 script
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import RIO

-- boilerplate, we'll get to this in a bit
data MyException = MyException
  deriving (Show, Typeable)
instance Exception MyException

main :: IO ()
main = runSimpleApp $ do
  logInfo "This will be called"
  let x = impureThrow MyException
  logInfo "This will also be called"
  if x -- forces evaluation
    then logInfo "This will never be called"
    else logInfo "Neither will this"
```

A common example of impure exceptions you'll see in Haskell code is
the `error` function. And in fact, sometimes it even looks and behaves
like `throwIO`, such as:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-12.21 script
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import RIO

main :: IO ()
main = runSimpleApp $ do
  logInfo "This will be called"
  error "Impure or synchronous exception"
  logInfo "Will this be called?"
```

It seems like `error` is the same as `throwIO` here. But it's _ever so
slightly_ different. What's actually happening is that `error "..."`
is receiving the type `RIO SimpleApp ()`. Then that action is forced,
which generates a synchronous exception.

The important point for our purposes here: once an impure exception is
forced, we treat it as a synchronous exception in every way. Which
brings us to the next bit.

### Sync vs async

There's a fundamental difference between how we handle synchronous
versus asynchronous exceptions. A sync exception means _something went
wrong locally_. We're free to clean up after ourselves, or fully
recover. For example, if I try to read a file, and get a "does not
exist" exception, it's valid to either rethrow the exception and give
up, or to print a warning and continue running with some default
value. For example:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-12.21 script
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import RIO

main :: IO ()
main = runSimpleApp $ do
  let fp = "myfile.txt"
  message <- readFileUtf8 fp `catchIO` \e -> do
    logWarn $ "Could not open " <> fromString fp <> ": " <> displayShow e
    pure "This is the default message"
  logInfo $ display message
```

An asynchronous exception is totally different. It is a demand from
outside of our control to shut down as soon as possible. If we were to
catch such an exception and recover from it, we would be breaking the
expectations of the thread that tried to shut us down. Instead, with
asynchronous exceptions, exception handling best practices tell us we're allowed to clean up, but not
recover. For example, the `timeout` function uses asynchronous
exceptions. What should the expected behavior here be?

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-12.21 script
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import RIO

oneSecond, fiveSeconds :: Int
oneSecond = 1000000
fiveSeconds = 5000000

main :: IO ()
main = runSimpleApp $ do
  res <- timeout oneSecond $ do
    logInfo "Inside the timeout"
    res <- tryAny $ threadDelay fiveSeconds `finally`
      logInfo "Inside the finally"
    logInfo $ "Result: " <> displayShow res
  logInfo $ "After timeout: " <> displayShow res
```

Bad async exception handling would allow the "Result: " message to
print. We don't want that to happen! Instead, we allow the `finally`
cleanup call to occur and then immediately exit. This ensures that
resource cleanup can happen (ensuring exception safety), while
disallowing large delays from async exceptions.

In sum, our goals are:

* Synchronous exceptions: allow both recovery and cleanup
* Asynchronous exceptions: allow cleanup, but disallow recovery

We'll see how the functions in `UnliftIO.Exception` fall into these two categories.

## Exception types

In addition to how we throw exceptions, there's also the issue of the
types of exceptions. This may be surprising, but the Haskell exception
system is modeled off of Java-style Object Oriented inheritance
(shocking, I know). There's a typeclass, `Exception`, and a data type
`SomeException` which is the ancestor of all exceptions.

How do you get OO-style inheritance into Haskell? Like this:

```haskell
data SomeException = forall e. Exception e => SomeException e

class (Typeable e, Show e) => Exception e where
  toException :: e -> SomeException
  fromException :: SomeException -> Maybe e
  displayException :: e -> String -- for pretty display purposes
```

Here's how this works: in order for a type to be an exception, it must
be possible to convert a value of that type into a `SomeException`
value (using the `toException` method). It must also be possible to
attempt to convert a `SomeException` into your type from
`fromException`, though that conversion may fail. And finally,
`SomeException` is nothing more than an existential type saying "I've
got something which is a instance of the `Exception` typeclass.

Still confused? Don't worry, that's normal. Let's see an example of
defining a simple exception type:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-12.21 script
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Data.Typeable (cast)
import RIO

data MyException = MyException
  deriving (Show, Typeable)
instance Exception MyException where
  -- these are the default implementations, so you can simply omit
  -- them
  toException e = SomeException e
  fromException (SomeException e) = cast e -- uses Typeable

main :: IO ()
main =
  runSimpleApp $
  throwIO MyException `catch` \MyException ->
  logInfo "I caught my own exception!"
```

This uses the `Typeable` typeclass, which allows for runtime type
analysis, which is what makes all of this magic work. Love it or hate
it, this is at the core of the exception handling mechanism in
Haskell.

We can also create hierarchies of exceptions. In my experience, these
aren't actually used that often (outside of async exceptions, which
we'll get to in a bit).

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-12.21 script
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}
import Data.Typeable (cast)
import RIO

data Parent = Parent1 Child1 | Parent2 Child2
  deriving (Show, Typeable)
instance Exception Parent

data Child1 = Child1
  deriving (Show, Typeable)
instance Exception Child1 where
  toException = toException . Parent1 -- cast up through the Parent type
  fromException se =
    case fromException se of
      Just (Parent1 c) -> Just c
      _ -> Nothing

data Child2 = Child2
  deriving (Show, Typeable)
instance Exception Child2 where
  toException = toException . Parent2 -- cast up through the Parent type
  fromException se =
    case fromException se of
      Just (Parent2 c) -> Just c
      _ -> Nothing

main :: IO ()
main = runSimpleApp $ do
  throwIO Child1 `catch` (\(_ :: SomeException) -> logInfo "Caught it!")
  throwIO Child1 `catch` (\(_ :: Parent) -> logInfo "Caught it again!")
  throwIO Child1 `catch` (\(_ :: Child1) -> logInfo "One more catch!")
  throwIO Child1 `catch` (\(_ :: Child2) -> logInfo "Missed!")
```

In this case, both `Child1` and `Child2` are children of the `Parent`
type, and `Parent` is a child of the `SomeException` type. Therefore,
if we throw a `Child1`, catching a `SomeException` or a `Parent` will
catch the `Child1`. However, trying to catch a `Child2` will _not_
catch the `Child1`, and the exception will escape.

Which brings us to...

### Type ambiguity

Why doesn't this compile?

```haskell
foo :: IO ()
foo = do
  resource <- openResource
  eitherResult <- try $ useResource resource
  closeResource resource
  case eitherResult of
    Left e -> throwIO e
    Right result -> pure result
```

The type of `try` is (slightly simplified):

```haskell
try :: Exception e => IO a -> IO (Either e a)
```

Notice the type variable `e`. `try` will catch whichever type of
exception you ask it to. But if you're unclear about which exception
type you care about, the compiler will complain about ambiguous
types. That's why, in our hierarchical exception above, I turned on
`ScopedTypeVariables` and included signatures like `` `catch` (\(_ ::
Child1) ->``.

We'll discuss in the recovering section below some common practices
around catching exceptions.

### Async exceptions

Previously, we pointed out that the difference between a synchronous
and asynchronous exception is how they are thrown (via `throwIO` or
`throwTo`). Unfortunately, there's no way to determine when catching
an exception how it was thrown, making it difficult to live up to our
goals above to never recover from an async exception. Fortunately, we
have a workaround: use a different type for async exceptions!

Using the hierarchical exception mechanism above, we have a new data
type, `SomeAsyncException`, which is a child of `SomeException`. All
exceptions which are thrown asynchronously must be a child of that
exception type. And conversely, asynchronous exceptions must _not_ be
thrown synchronously. The `UnliftIO.Exception` module has quite a few
safeguards in place to ensure both of these conditions are met.
Please see the "Async
Exception Handling in Haskell" article above for the gory details.

Upshot of all of this:

* If you define your own exception type for asynchronous exceptions,
  make it a child of `SomeAsyncException`. (Note: this is a pretty
  unusual thing to do.)
* If you define your own exception type for synchronous exceptions,
  don't make it a child of `SomeAsyncException`.
* The functions we'll mention below for cleaning up and recovering are
  able to determine whether an exception is sync or async based on its
  type.

Cool? Awesome! That's quite enough backstory. Let's start covering
usage of the API.

## Throwing

We're not going to talk about using async exceptions to kill other
threads, since we're not talking about concurrent
programming. Instead, please check out the [async
library](/library/async) and the `race` and `cancel` functions it
provides. Instead, we're going to focus on synchronous exception
throwing.

The most basic function for this is:

```haskell
throwIO :: (MonadIO m, Exception e) => e -> m a
```

Given any value which is an instance of `Exception`, you can throw it
as a runtime exception for any monad which is a `MonadIO`
instance. This works for built in exception types, as well as any you
define yourself.

Sometimes you want to use synchronous exceptions but don't want to go
through the overhead of defining your own exception type. In those
cases, you can use the helper:

```haskell
throwString :: (MonadIO m, HasCallStack) => String -> m a
```

`throwString` looks pretty similar to `error`:

```haskell
error :: HasCallStack => String -> a
```

The difference is that the former throws a synchronous exception of type `StringException`,
whereas the latter creates a thunk which, when evaluated, throws a
synchronous exception of type `ErrorCall`. To demonstrate the difference:

```haskell
throwString "foo" :: IO () -- throws an exception
error "foo" :: IO () -- throws an exception, because the thunk is evaluated
throwString "foo" `seq` pure () :: IO () -- doesn't throw an exception!
error "foo" `seq` pure () :: IO () -- does throw an exception!
throwString "foo" :: () -- type error
error "foo" :: () -- compiles, and when evaluated will throw an exception
```

Typically, we advise away from exceptions in pure code, and thus
`error` is best avoided. But _if_ you really want an exception in pure
code, you can also use `impureThrow`, which lets you use your own
exception type:

```haskell
impureThrow :: Exception e => e -> a
```

## Cleaning up

Cleaning up allows you to define some action which should be run when
an exception occurs. However, after your action is run, the exception
will be rethrown. In other words, when cleaning up, you *cannot
recover* from an exception. This makes cleanup functions safe to use
with asynchronous exceptions.

The simplest cleanup function is `finally`, which ensures that an
action is run whether or not an exception is thrown:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-12.21 script
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import RIO

main :: IO ()
main = runSimpleApp $ do
  logInfo "This will print first"
  throwString "This will print last as an error message"
    `finally` logInfo "This will print second"
  logInfo "This will never print"
```

Similar is the `onException` function, which will only run its second
argument if the first argument exited with an exception.

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-12.21 script
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import RIO

main :: IO ()
main = runSimpleApp $ do
  logInfo "This will print first"
    `onException` logInfo "This will never print"
  throwString "This will print last as an error message"
    `onException` logInfo "But this will print second"
  logInfo "This will never print"
```

And the most commonly used of this cleanup functions is likely
`bracket`. `bracket` is so popular that there's even a style of
functions called "the bracket pattern." `bracket` takes a resource
allocation function, a resource cleanup function, and a function to
use the resource, and ensures that cleanup occurs. It looks like:

```haskell
bracket
  :: MonadUnliftIO m
  => m a -- ^ allocate
  -> (a -> m b) -- ^ cleanup
  -> (a -> m c) -- ^ use
  -> m c
```

**Exercise** Implement a `withBinaryFile` function (specialized to
`IO` for simplicity) using `bracket`, `hClose`, and
`System.IO.openBinaryFile`.

There are a few other functions available, like
`withException`. Overall, these functions are fairly easy to
understand, but take some experience to know how to use correctly.

## Recovering

The exception recovery functions allow you to catch an exception and
prevent it from propagating higher up the call stack. These functions
only work on synchronous exceptions; they will totally ignore
asynchronous exceptions. We'll start with the `try` family of
functions, and then introduce the very similar `catch` and `handle`
families.

The basic function is `try`:

```haskell
try :: (MonadUnliftIO m, Exception e) => m a -> m (Either e a)
```

If the provided action was successful, it will return a `Right`,
otherwise it will return a `Left`. And if the provided action throws a
different type of exception than expected, that exception will be
rethrown.

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-12.21 script
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import RIO

main :: IO ()
main = runSimpleApp $ do
  res1 <- try $ throwString "This will be caught"
  logInfo $ displayShow (res1 :: Either StringException ())

  res2 <- try $ pure ()
  logInfo $ displayShow (res2 :: Either StringException ())

  res3 <- try $ throwString "This will be caught"
  logInfo $ displayShow (res3 :: Either SomeException ())

  res4 <- try $ throwString "This will *not* be caught"
  logInfo $ displayShow (res4 :: Either IOException ())
```

Having to specify the type of exception you want can be tedious, so
there are two helper functions that address common cases. The `tryIO`
function is specialized to `IOException`, which is the type used by
many function in standard libraries which perform I/O. For example:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-12.21 script
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import RIO

main :: IO ()
main = runSimpleApp $ do
  result <- tryIO $ readFileUtf8 "does-not-exist"
  case result of
    Left e -> logError $ "Error reading file: " <> displayShow e
    Right text -> logInfo $ "That's surprising... " <> display text
```

Notice how, in the above, we didn't need any explicit type
signatures. The type of `e` is constrained to be `IOException`.

The other helper function is `tryAny`, which constraints the exception
to be `SomeException`. As we discussed above, `SomeException` is the
parent exception type in the hierarchy, and therefore this function
will catch _all_ synchronous exceptions. We can replace `tryIO` with
`tryAny` above, and the error message will remain unchanged.

One more aspect of the `try` family: remember those pesky impure
exceptions? Well, it's possible for them to leak through. For example:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-12.21 script
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import RIO

main :: IO ()
main = runSimpleApp $ do
  result1 <- tryAny $ error "This will be caught"
  case result1 of
    Left _ -> logInfo "Exception was caught"
    Right () -> logInfo "How was this successful?!?"

  result2 <- tryAny $ pure $ error "This will escape!"
  case result2 of
    Left _ -> logInfo "Exception was caught"
    Right () -> logInfo "How was this successful?!?"
```

In the first case, the impure exception was forced, turned into a
synchronous exception, and caught by `tryAny`. In the second case,
however, we wrapped up the impure exception with `pure`, preventing it
from being forced. As far as `tryAny` is concerned, the second action
succeeded! Then, when we try to pattern match on `result2`, we force
the impure exception hiding inside the `Right`.

To work around this, we have the `tryAnyDeep` function, which forces
the value using `NFData`. Swapping out `tryAny` with `tryAnyDeep` will
result in both exceptions being caught.

Once you understand how to use `try`, using `catch` and `handle` is
basically the same thing. Instead of returning an `Either` value, you
provide these functions with actions to perform with the exception if
one occurs. The type signatures are:

```haskell
catch :: (MonadUnliftIO m, Exception e) => m a -> (e -> m a) -> m a
handle :: (MonadUnliftIO m, Exception e) => (e -> m a) -> m a -> m a
```

`handle` is just `catch` with the order of arguments reversed. These
functions come with all the variations of `try` mentioned aboved
(e.g. `catchIO`, `handleAny`). Feel free to use whichever is the most
convenient.

**Exercise** Implement `catch` and `handle` in terms of `try`, and
implement `try` in terms of `catch`.

## Going deeper

This is a relatively high level overview of exception handling in
Haskell. As mentioned, the trick is to get a lot of practice using the
functions above. And if you're interested in getting a much deeper
intuition, please check out [Async Exception Handling in
