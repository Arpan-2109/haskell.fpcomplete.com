title: About FP Complete and Haskell
---

<p class="lead">Dependable server software through better languages and tools</p>

FP Complete's mission is to improve the state of software quality in
the world. We believe software should be reliable, efficient, and
maintainable. Software projects must have clear vision and direction
while remaining responsive to changes in requirements. The world today
depends on software. We want to make that software better.

We've chosen Haskell as our primary tool in the fight for better
software. We believe that Haskell balances three business goals:

* Fast time to market
* More maintainable software
* Better performance

## Haskell's successes

Instead of repeating ourselves here, please see our [promote
Haskell](/promote) page, which contains information on Haskell's
industry successes. Haskell is used in production at banks, life
sciences companies, blockchains, and web development regularly.

## FP Complete's history

FP Complete is founded and made up of individuals who have contributed
to the Haskell ecosystem. Many FP Complete engineers are prolific open
source Haskell authors. As a company, we have spearheaded initiatives
our research indicated would allow more companies to adopt Haskell,
such as:

* [The Stack build tool](https://haskellstack.org)
* [Stackage](https://www.stackage.org)
* [The RIO standard library](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio)
* [The School of Haskell](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/)

We continue to use Haskell ourselves for projects large and small,
help our customers use it, and recommend it across the board.
