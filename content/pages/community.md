The Haskell community has many different avenues of communication
online. Some of the top methods the FP Complete team recommends are:

* [Commercial Haskell Gitter](https://gitter.im/commercialhaskell/commercialhaskell)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/haskell)
* [Commercial Haskell Discourse](https://discourse.commercialhaskell.com/) *experimental*

There are many more resources, such as in person meetups, IRC
channels, and mailing lists. Instead of duplicating content here,
please check out the relevant pages on haskell.org:
