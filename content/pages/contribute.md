Ready to start contributing to an open source Haskell project? Great!
Contributing to an active Haskell project can be a great way to
exercise your Haskell skills and get some feedback from others in the
community.

While there are many projects worth contributing to, the list below is
curated for projects which actively encourage newcomer contributions,
and should be well set up for mentoring people still learning the
language.

<small>If you'd like to have your project included in this list, please click the edit link above and send a PR to this page.</small>

Typically, if you're interested in contributing to a project, find an
issue on its issue tracker and drop a comment asking if it would be a
good issue to get started with. Many of the links below are filtered
for issues specifically tagged for newcomers.
